For Professor J. Frochte

Two ideas for a potential 3rd edition of your book :-)

Two ideas seen on Kaggle:

(1) Define outliers and create a new column in Pandas BEFORE normalization or standardization.

(2) How to deal with MCAR / MAR at the same time


Thank you for sharing your passion and knowledge with us!
